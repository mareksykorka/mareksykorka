<!-- ================== Description ================== -->
## ℹ️ About me,

I'm **Marek Sýkorka** a "Junior" Associate Software Developer at [VONSCH s.r.o.](https://www.vonsch.sk/?lang=en), a company that specializes in the field of   industrial and power electronics. I've lately graduated 🎓 from [Slovak University of Technology, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology](https://www.fei.stuba.sk/english.html?page_id=793) in the field of [Robotics and Cybernetics](https://urk.fei.stuba.sk/) with a Bachelors degree. I'm continuing to study for an engineering degree and possibly further 🙃.
    
That's probably the reason why most of my repositories are school project related. I want to use GitHub for my personal projects and experimentation; however, I haven't had much time recently. Until then, have a blast with some of my overengineered school projects. 😉 Oh and if it wasn't clear I'm from Slovakia.
